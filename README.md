# BerlinClock Kata

Hello, this is the result of my approach to the Berlin Clock kata test.
During this kata I used TDD, Kotlin and Jetpack compose.


# How to run the project.

## 1) Import the project into android studio using VCS (git clone)

## 2) Select either a virtual device or a physical device 

## 3) Run the "app" configuration on the selected device

## 4) Unit tests

If you want to check the unit tests and run them simply navigate in the "test" folder and run the test batch from the "BerlinClockTest" file. You can also run the test of the "ClockViewModelTest" file.
